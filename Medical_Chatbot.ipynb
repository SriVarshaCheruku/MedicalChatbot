            "  The symptoms of heart disease in women can be similar to those in men, such as chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness. However, some women may have different symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, swelling in the ankles and feet, and difficulty sleeping. It’s important to note that many women with heart disease have no symptoms at all, which is why regular check-ups and screenings are crucial for early detection and treatment.\n"
